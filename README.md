AppManager is a Libadwaita-powered desktop utility that makes installing and uninstalling AppImages on GNOME 45–49 painless. Double-click any `.AppImage` to open a macOS-style drag-and-drop sheet, pick between portable or extracted modes, and AppManager will move/extract the payload, wire up desktop entries, and copy icons.

## Features

- 📦 **Drag-and-drop installer** — mimics the familiar App→Applications flow, showing the AppImage icon on the left and your `~/Applications` folder on the right.
- 🧠 **Smart install modes** — automatically chooses between portable (move the AppImage) and extracted (unpack to `~/Applications/.installed/AppRun`) while letting you override it.
- 🗂️ **Desktop integration** — extracts the bundled `.desktop` file via `7z`, rewrites `Exec` and `Icon`, and stores it in `~/.local/share/applications`.
- 📋 **Install registry + preferences** — main window lists installed apps, default mode, and cleanup behaviors, all stored with GSettings.

## Requirements

- GNOME 45–49 desktop
- `valac`, `meson`, `ninja`
- Libraries: `libadwaita-1`, `gtk4`, `gio-2.0`, `glib-2.0`, `json-glib-1.0`, `gee-0.8`
- Runtime tools: `7z`/`p7zip-full`

## Build & Install

```bash
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
meson install -C build --destdir "$HOME/.local"
```

If you prefer a true per-user install (no post-install relocation), configure Meson to use your local prefix directly:

```bash
meson setup build --prefix=$HOME/.local
meson compile -C build
meson install -C build
```

> **Note:** Adjust the `--destdir` or run `meson install -C build` with elevated privileges if you want a system-wide installation. After installing, refresh desktop databases with `update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications`.

## Usage

- **Double-click** a `.AppImage`: AppManager claims the `application/x-iso9660-appimage` MIME type, shows the drag window, and installs after you drag the icon onto `~/Applications` (or click Install).
- **Preferences**: Launch AppManager from the application menu to tweak defaults and review installed items.
- **CLI helpers**: `app-manager --install /path/to/AppImage`, `app-manager --uninstall /path/or/checksum`, and `app-manager --is-installed /path/to/AppImage` for scripting.

## Development Notes

- Shared logic (installer, registry, metadata) lives under `src/core/` and is reused by both the UI and CLI entry points.
- Temporary extraction directories live under `/tmp/appmgr-*` and are automatically cleaned after installation.
- Install metadata persists in `~/.local/share/app-manager/installations.json`.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for deeper internals and installer flows.
